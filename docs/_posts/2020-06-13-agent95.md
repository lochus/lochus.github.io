We get the following message when visiting this page:

*You don't look like our agent!
We will only give our flag to our Agent 95! He is still running an old version of Windows...* 

Looking up the user agent for Windows 95, catching the request with Burp, and forwarding the request gives us the flag:

Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows 95; BCD2000)
